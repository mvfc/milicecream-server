# milicecream-server
Back-end written in NodeJS using Express and Mongoose

This is the backend for an application made for selling products inside our apartment building.

People will enter their apartment, products wanted and then payment method.

We will also keep track of our product purchases so we can have a better balance on how profitable our sales have been.
